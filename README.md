I have built a fully functional e-commerce website using React, Angular, Node.js, and Django, integrating MongoDB and PostgreSQL for efficient data management. The website includes essential features like user authentication, a product catalog, a shopping cart, a secure payment gateway, and an intuitive admin dashboard. With a vibrant and responsive UI, it ensures a seamless shopping experience for users. This project showcases my expertise in full-stack web development, combining multiple frameworks to create a dynamic and scalable online store
